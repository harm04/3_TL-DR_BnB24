## Key Features

- **Anonymous Reporting:** Users can submit reports without revealing their identity.
- **Secure Communication Channels:** End-to-end encryption ensures confidentiality in all communications.
- **Multiple Reporting Channels:** Web forms, mobile apps, and hotline numbers cater to diverse user preferences.
- **Geo-Tagging:** Capture and visualize the location of reported incidents.
- **Evidence Upload Capability:** Securely upload documents, images, or other evidence related to reported incidents.
- **Comprehensive Case Management System:** Track and manage reported cases with features for categorization and status tracking.
- **Anonymous Messaging System:** Facilitate secure communication between investigators and whistleblowers.

## Tech Stack
